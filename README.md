This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.

## More details from Hunter

- It's important to know basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript before learning React, Next.js, and Supabase.
- This project uses React, Tailwind CSS, and Next.js. I deployed it on Vercel.
- I followed the beginner's guide at https://react.dev/ to learn React, they're very easy to follow.
- I followed the beginner's guide at https://nextjs.org/docs to learn Next.js, it's also easy to follow.
- I was planning on using Supabase for the database and backend. It's pretty simple to use with tutorials. I used this one to understand the basics (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU7GwCOgvNY)
- For putting sign-in capability on the website, I was planning on following the code here (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDJcdDa6la0).

## Notes on GitHub
- *Make sure you're signed in to your GitHub account on VSCode (Bottom left)*
- *Go to VSCode and navigate to the parent directory you want your project*
- git clone https://...
- git pull origin main (get the latest main version and have it copied over your code)
- *Avoid doing just "git push" because it will go to the main branch immediately*
- git branch branch-name (make a branch apart from main)
- git checkout branch-name (naviage to a specific branch)
- git branch (check your current branch)
- git add . (Use these next 3 commands every time you want to commit)
- git commit -m "Commit to branch"
- git push origin branch-name
- *Do add, commit, push every time you want to add new code
- *Go to GitHub and make a pull request on the latest commit(s) which will be reviewed, branches can be deleted after merge
- *Forking is for open source contributions, so we don't need to worry about it here
